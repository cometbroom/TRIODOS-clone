# TRIODOS-clone
My attempt to clone the website of Triodos banking at https://www.triodos.nl/ using only HTML and SASS/CSS.

Here's a screenshot of how it looks:

## Development

I challenged myself to make this without copying anything over other than img assets. It was quite laborious but it taught me a lot about CSS Grid.
